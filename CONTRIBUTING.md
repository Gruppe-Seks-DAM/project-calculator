# 🧩 How We Work (Workflow)

We use a simple three-layer branching model:

## **1. Main branch (`main`)**

* Always stable.
* Only receives code through pull requests from `dev`.

## **2. Development branch (`dev`)**

* Integration branch for all work.
* All feature and fix branches merge into `dev`.

## **3. Task branches**

* Created from `dev`.
* Named using the issue or task ID.
* Example: `task/42-add-time-estimation`.

### **Subtask branches (optional)**

* Only optionally used when a task contains subtasks tied directly to a parent issue.
* Example: `task/42-subtask/ui-refactor`.

**No other branch types should be created.**
